<br>DETAILS OF THE DATASET:
 This pizza sales dataset  contains 12 relevant columns/features:
 <br>● order_id: Unique identifier for each order placed by a table. 
<br>● order_details_id: Unique identifier for each pizza placed within each order (pizzas of the same type and size are kept in the same row, and the quantity increases).
 <br>● pizza_id: Unique key identifier that ties the pizza ordered to its details, like size and price 
<br>● quantity: Quantity ordered for each pizza of the same type and size.
<br>● order_date: Date the order was placed (entered into the system prior to cooking & serving).
 <br>● order_time: Time the order was placed (entered into the system prior to cooking & serving).
<br>● unit_price: Price of the pizza in USD.
<br> ● total_price: unit_price * quantity.
<br> ● pizza_size: Size of the pizza (Small, Medium, Large, X Large, or XX Large). 
<br>● pizza_type: Unique key identifier that ties the pizza ordered to its details, like size and price.
<br> ● pizza_ingredients: ingredients used in the pizza as shown in the menu (they all include Mozzarella. Cheese, even if not specified; and they all include Tomato Sauce, unless another sauce is specified). 
<br>● pizza_name: Name of the pizza as shown in the menu.

<br>TASKS TO BE PERFORMED:
<br>1.What days and times do we tend to be busiest? 
<br>2. How many pizzas are we selling during peak periods? 
<br>3. What are our best and worst-selling pizzas?
<br>4. What's our average order value?
<br>5. KPI sheet recording valuable aspects like-Total no of order placed, Total pizza sold, Average order value, Average pizza per order & Total revenue. 
<br>6. Revenue determination by week, hour, year & item.
<br>7. Percentage of sales categorised by pizza category & size
<br>8.Top 5 pizza by revenue, total no order placed & sold.
<br>9. Bottom 5 pizzas by revenue, total no order placed & sold.
<br>10. An interactive dashboard that contains a comprehensive pizza sales revenue analysis.

<br>PROCESS APPLIED:
<br>● Verifying data for any missing values or anomalies.
<br>● Made sure data is consistent & clean with respect to data type & format and values used.
<br>● Created multiple calculated fields in order to generate KPI section and make visulaisations easier for other charts and dashboard too.
<br>● Created interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs for extracting data driven insights. 
<br>● used pizza category and order date as a filter for all the charts and graphs and applied it as a slicer in dashboard to make it dynamic.
 
<br>Visualisation include following charts:KPI’s, Revenue by Week, Revenue by Hour, Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category, Percentage of sales by pizza size, Total Orders & Pizza Sold by Pizza Category(DASHBOARD 1/HOME DASHBOARD).

<br>Visualisation include following charts: Top 5 pizza by revenue, Top 5 pizza by total pizzas sold, Top 5 pizza by total orders, Botttom 5 pizza by revenue, Bottom 5 pizza by total pizzas sold, Bottom 5 pizza by total orders(DASHBOARD 2/Best and Worst Sellers DASHBOARD).

<br>PROJECT INSIGHTS:
<br>●Peak orders for daily basis are usually from 12:00PM TO 01:00PM and in evening from 04:pm to  07:00pm.
<br>●Significant variations are noticed in weekly orders with huge peak during 48th week from the month of December.
<br>●Classic category contributes to maximum sales, total no of orders placed and total pizza sold.
<br>●Large pizza size contributes to maximum pizza sales
<br>● The Brie Carre category contributes to lowest sales, lowest total no of orders placed and total pizza sold.

<br>CONCLUSION:
<br>I have managed to create a comprehensive pizza sales revenue analysis using Tableau. This project is meant to visualize sales trends, identify key insights, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall sales.
